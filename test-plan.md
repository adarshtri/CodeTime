Intro:
CodeTime is a plugin for Sublime Text editor and is used as a tool for performance benchmarking and result comparison. Enabling the plugin to the sublime text editor will be able to perform an analysis of a user’s time spent on various files, multiple languages, day wise analysis on the user interface dashboard for easier human readability. Also, the user will be able to see the total amount of time spent coding and how many files he worked on in total. 

Usage :
The user has to open sublime text editor and enable the codetime plugin in the editor as mentioned in the installation and usage guide. After this is done, user can run the dashboard and signup if he/she is a new user. If the user is already existing, then he/she have to login using their user name and password. Upon this, an api token will get generated which is used for a user’s unique identification. 
The user has to return to the sublime text editor and open the file he wants to work on and start coding. The data is getting logged for the respective user. The user can choose to switch to different files to work on in between and he can switch the programming languages as well. Once the work is done, he can close the text editor and view his work analysis on the UI- dashboard. He will be able to see the time (in seconds) he took to work on the given file and on the programming language. 

Motivation :
The task in Homework 3 assignment was to record the time taken by human beings to detect and rectify bugs introduced in three different languages. Most of the process was automated but there is still a scope of human errors to record time manually. CodeTime is a solution to this error caused by humans as it involves their minimal involvement. The user who is given the task to detect and rectify bugs can follow the same process of opening the file they want to correct and start debugging. The start time and end time will automatically get recorded as soon as the user opens a file and closes it. He can view his result on the dashboard later. The time taken during this process can be compared with the time taken by the group 18’s / some other group’s previous report in homework 3 and the expected result should be that the time taken by enabling codeTime will be lesser than the previous tests performed in the ordinary manner.
