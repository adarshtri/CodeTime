# Test Plan

In this document we describe our test plan for the project in terms of performance benchmarking and results comparisons.

## Introduction:
CodeTime is a plugin for Sublime Text editor and is used as a tool for performance benchmarking and result comparison. Enabling the plugin to the sublime text editor will be able to perform an analysis of a user’s time spent on various files, multiple languages, day wise analysis on the user interface dashboard for easier human readability. Also, the user will be able to see the total amount of time spent coding and how many files he worked on in total. 

## Motivation

The task in Homework 3 assignment was to record the time taken by human beings to detect and rectify bugs introduced in three different languages for game of life. Most of the process was automated but there is still a scope of human errors to record time manually. CodeTime could be a solution to this error caused by humans as it involves their minimal involvement. The user who is given the task to detect and rectify bugs can follow the same process of opening the file they want to correct and start debugging. The start time and end time will automatically get recorded as soon as the user opens a file and closes it. He can view his result on the dashboard later. The time taken during this process can be compared with the time taken by the group 18’s / some other group’s previous report in homework 3 and the expected result should be that the time taken by enabling codeTime will be more accurate than the previous tests performed in Homework 3.
